A web application for editing JSON puzzle files for the MAGiE game

## [/puzzles](puzzles) is the main application.
The basic data model is:
A Menu is a list of Categories.
A Category is a list of Levels.
And a Level is a list of Puzzles.

The service was made to feed a game developed in Unity.
There is a partially built Python command-line client for the game.
And similarly a React application.
